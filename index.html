                    Everyone knows to wash their hands.
                    We’re all told it’s important to finish taking antibiotic prescriptions.
                    But what do you know about when your computer gets sick?
                    Viruses, trojan horses, and worms are the new infectious diseases and the public remains woefully uninformed.
                    M3RSA plans to banish the ignorance and prepare the world for it’s modern dangers.

                In this day and age cyber attacks are more dangerous and more common than they’ve ever been before and most cyber security problems are caused by human error. 
                This is avoidable. 
                We would have far fewer security breaches if people simply new how to recognize suspicious activity and understood how malware works.
                 The vast majority of people are grossly uninformed as to how to avoid these cyber security problems and I see this as a serious oversight. 
                 My proposal is to create a campaign to inform people how to stay safe online. 
                 I’m molding this after medical safety information campaigns informing people about diseases and how they are transmitted. 
                 I got the idea from the term computer viruses. 
                 I was thinking about how much like actual viruses they are but how they aren't treated the same way. 
                 Maybe if we tried to inform people about the dangers of things like computer viruses in a more conventional way like we do with actual viruses the general public would be better informed. 
                 The campaign would include posters, leaflets and a website. 
                 I think the physical aspect of posters and leaflets would be helpful with informing people who are less technically literate and therefore need this information the most.
