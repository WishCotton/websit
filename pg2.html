                The more information people have the better it is for everyone.
                The security breaches that are caused by these errors affect everyone and could potentially do so in very dangerous ways.
                These breaches have caused people to lose their money, their personal information and is a key aspect in politics and political conflicts.
                Everyone has the potential to be targeted by these kinds of attacks so it is in all of our best interest to have the general public as informed as possible.
